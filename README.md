C++ Math Library Test
=====================

I am in the process of selecting a math library to use for game development in
C++ and this repo contains a small test of several libraries before I make a
decision on which to use. When I have finished my test I will add the results
here.

My requirements are:
* C++
* Matrix operations
* Vector operations
* Complex number support
* Quarternian operations
* Cross-platform, easy to compile on different platforms with different
  compilers.
* Fast. SIMD instruction support is preferred.
* Easy to use and understand.
* Permissive license. Accreditation is acceptable.

At the time of writing, the libraries I will be testing are
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/), and
[CML](http://cmldev.net/).

This project *will* be able to be built and run with CMake. I intend to test
each library on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and Android.
